This expense does include amounts charged to auxiliary enterprises, hospitals, and independent operations. Also includes information technology expenses related to operation and maintenance of plant activities if the institution separately budgets and expenses information technology resources (otherwise these expenses are included in institutional support).

	FASB institutions are required to allocate O&M costs to other functional categories (e.g., instruction, research, etc.) while GASB institutions can allocate O&M costs OR report it as a separate functional category.  In an effort to align FASB and GASB O&M expenses, from FY 2010 to FY 2015, O&M was reported as both a functional and natural expense category in IPEDS, causing its total to be equal to zero. However, beginning with FY 2016, both FASB and GASB institutions are required to allocate O&M to all the functions and report it as a natural expense category. 

Prior to fiscal year 2017 this variable would always be equal to zero. Like other natural classification categories OM was reported for all  expense functions (survey column 4) . Unlike other natural classification categories OM also appeared as a function (line 8). Institutions would report positive values of salaries and wages, benefits, depreciation, interest and other expenses on the OM (survey line 8).  However total OM line 8 column 1 was always zero and negative values were reported in the intersection of line 8 and column 4 to balance out the total of all expenses of OM distributed to the functional categories.
