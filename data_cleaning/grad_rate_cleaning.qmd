Cleaning up School Info Data
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

Read in the school CSV and merge with the schools we have athetic spending data list.

```{r}
# read in the school info csv
schools <- read.csv("data/school_info/school_info.csv",header = TRUE) 

# rename the instiution name column
s_col_names <- c('UNITID','school_name')
colnames(schools) <- s_col_names

# reduce to just two columns
schools <- schools |> select(c('UNITID','school_name'))

# read in the d1 schools csv
d1_schools <- read.csv('Name_Standardizations.csv')

# remove NA and trim any extra spaces
d1_schools <- na.omit(d1_schools)
d1_schools$financial.name <- updated_string <- str_trim(d1_schools$financial.name, "right")

# merge with the schools data to just get the UNITIDs of the ones we want
d1_schools <- merge(d1_schools,schools,by.x = 'financial.name',by.y= 'school_name', all.x = TRUE)

# reorder the columns and arrange my my_id
d1_schools <- d1_schools[,c("my_id","UNITID","financial.name",'school_name')] |> arrange(my_id)
# rename the columns
d1_col_names <- c('d1_id','UNITID','school_name','short_name')
colnames(d1_schools) <- d1_col_names

# remove Air Force since they dont work financial like the other institutions
d1_schools <- d1_schools[d1_schools$short_name != 'Air Force', ]

str(d1_schools)
#write.csv(d1_schools,'UNITID_school_names.csv',row.names = FALSE)
```

Create a function taht gets the graduation rate data for the schools

```{r}
load_grad_data <- function(f, grad_df) {
    # read in the file
    file <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE)

    # extrac the two columns needed, one feature of interest and the merging key
    file <- file |> select('UNITID','GRTOTLT')

    # the data set has multiple observations for each school based on the type of student they are
    # need to aggregate 
    file_agg <- file |>  group_by(UNITID) |> 
    summarise(GRTOTLT_total = sum(GRTOTLT, na.rm = TRUE))

    # rename the column with the year for the graduation
    year = str_sub(f, -22,-19)
    year = strtoi(year)
    new_col_name = paste(year,"_grad_rate_total",sep='')
    colnames(file_agg)[2] <- new_col_name

    # merge with d1_schools to get only the schools we sant since the csv is thousands of rows
    grad_df <- merge(grad_df, file_agg, by="UNITID", all.x = TRUE) 
    return(grad_df)
}
```

Run the function for all the files

```{r}
grad_df <- load_grad_data('data/raw_grad_data/2018_Graduate_Data.csv', grad_df)
grad_df <- load_grad_data('data/raw_grad_data/2019_Graduate_Data.csv', grad_df)
grad_df <- load_grad_data('data/raw_grad_data/2020_Graduate_Data.csv', grad_df)
grad_df <- load_grad_data('data/raw_grad_data/2021_Graduate_Data.csv', grad_df)
grad_df <- load_grad_data('data/raw_grad_data/2022_Graduate_Data.csv', grad_df)

str(grad_df)

```


Save to a csv

```{r}
write.csv(grad_df,'data/clean_pop_and_grad_data/graduation_rates_2018-2022.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```
