To work with branches:

1. Create branch of your name in the branches settings (can do on github website)
2. from your local device/terminal/VSCode:
3. use "git checkout <yourname>" to switch to your branch
4. use "git pull" to ensure your branch is up to date
5. use "git push" from your branch to save local changes
6. navigate to main using "git checkout main"
7. use "git merge <yourname>" to update the main branch with the changes from your branch

8. if you are behind main, switch to your branch ("git checkout <yourname>") and then merge with main using "git merge main" and then "git push main" to update on website

After these steps/using these commands, your branch should show 0 steps behind and 0 steps ahead of main.
